# How to fast build Web Application with Strapi + Angular

For us, developers, starting a new web project can be a tedious job. It raises questions like:

1. What technology should I use for the front-end?
2. What technology should I use for the back-end?
3. What database is the best?

Because nowadays all Javascript technologies like **React**, **Angular** and **Vue** are very popular for building Web applications, so we can get an answer for the first question very fast. But what about the back-end? Should I use **NodeJS** or **.NET Core** ? Is it better to use a **relational** or **non-relational database** ? Well, Strapi has the answer to all these questions.
